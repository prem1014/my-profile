            <h4><b>IIFE</b> (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) 
                is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is
                defined.It is also called as Self-Executing Anonymous Function.
                It has mainly two parts 
                <ul>
                    <li> 
                        The first is the anonymous function with lexical
                         scope enclosed within the Grouping Operator ().
                         This prevents from polluting the global scope.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                            The second part is creating the immediately executing function expression (), through which the JavaScript engine will directly interpret the function.
                    </li>
                </ul>
